Bolts: Stainless Verified Scala

This repository showcases additional examples of code verified using
[Stainless](https://stainless.epfl.ch) system for Scala. The benchmarks
executed from `run-tests.sh` should run correctly with a 
recent master version of Stainless.

Some highlights:
  * [Verified Data Structures](data-structures), mostly functional ones
  * [A few verified algorithms](algorithms)
  * [Functional Programming Principles](fp-principles), inspired by some of the Scala course labs
  * [Software foundations](software-foundations), inspired by the Software foundations book
  * [Expression Compiler](expression-compiler), correctness of an expression compiler
